# 📚 Shiksha – Smart Classroom Monitoring System

**Shiksha** is a smart classroom analytics platform that leverages machine learning to monitor student behavior, attention, and participation. It includes a modern frontend built with **Next.js** and a backend powered by **Python**, which processes classroom videos to extract insights on student engagement.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

Shiksha is designed to help educators better understand student behavior in physical classrooms. Using machine learning, the system analyzes videos of classroom sessions to:

- Recognize students from previously uploaded images
- Detect and track attention, distraction, and participation
- Generate CSV reports with detailed weekly analytics
- Display student-wise performance data on the frontend

The platform has three roles:
- **Admin**: Can manage teachers and upload classroom videos for analysis.
- **Teacher**: Can view insights and performance data of their assigned students.
- **Student**: Can view their own behavior and performance over time.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🔧 Frontend (Next.js)

1. Navigate to the frontend folder:

```bash
cd frontend
````

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

### ⚙️ Backend (Python)

1. Navigate to the backend folder:

```bash
cd backend
```

2. (Recommended) Create a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Start the backend server:

```bash
python app.py   # or main.py, depending on your entry file
```

> Ensure the backend runs on a separate port, like `http://localhost:5000`, and configure API endpoints in the frontend accordingly.
